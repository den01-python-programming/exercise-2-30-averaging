# Exercise 2.30 Averaging

Create a method called `average` that calculates the average of the numbers passed as parameters. The previously created method `sum` must be used inside this method!

Define the method in the following template:

```python
def sum(number1, number2, number3, number4):
    # you can copy your implementation of the method sum here

def average(number1, number2, number3, number4):
    # write your code here
    # calculate the sum of the elements by calling the method sum

def main():
    result = average(4, 3, 6, 1)
    print("Average: " + str(result))
```

The output of the program:

```plaintext
Average: 3.5
```
